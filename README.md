# Vedant-Asset Assignment

This is a GitHub README file for the task, which was assigned to me by Vedant Asset. The task involved creating a website design using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create a responsive and functional website. The website was designed using modern web development technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery.

## Technologies Used

HTML5: Used to create the structure of the website and its content.


CSS3: Used to add styles and layout to the website.


JavaScript: Used to make the website functional and interactive.


Bootstrap: Used to create a responsive and mobile-friendly design.


jQuery: Used to simplify JavaScript code and manipulate HTML elements.


## Features

Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
Interactive navigation menu that collapses on small screens.

## How to Use

To use this website design, simply download or clone the repository from GitHub and open the index.html file in a web browser. The website should load and display properly on most modern web browsers.
I have also pushed the code on Netlify and made it live.

## Things I have done to make the website fast

 First, I made sure to write lean JavaScript and CSS code to reduce the overall file size. Additionally, I kept image sizes low to further optimize the website.

While our website currently doesn't make any HTTP requests, if we were to add HTTPS requests in the future, I would minify the code by removing white space and comments, and combine JavaScript files together to reduce the number of HTTP requests the website is making.


## Conclusion

Overall, this project was a great learning experience that allowed me to use various web development technologies to create a functional and responsive website design. If you have any questions or feedback about this project, please feel free to contact me.
